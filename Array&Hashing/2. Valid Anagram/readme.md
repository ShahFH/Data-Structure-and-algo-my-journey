# Valid Anagram

Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.


```
Example 1:

Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true


Example 2:

Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
```


## Approach
We can achive this by using hashmap 

### cases 
```
both veriable have
1. Same length
2. Same letters just like palindrome
